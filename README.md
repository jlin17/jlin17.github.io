# Assorted Stuff

Random projects and programs made by that one guy in your class. I'd put an index but some of the things here are pretty much useless to anyone but me (and honestly, even that's debatable).

But here are some links here and there to some things that make some sense:

- [centerpiece](/centerpiece/)
- [physics](/physics/)
- [psych](/psych/)
- [sanctuary](/sanctuary/)
- [wynn](/wynn/)

If you need explanation, email me at [jlin17@terpmail.umd.edu](mailto:jlin17@terpmail.umd.edu) and I might be able to explain what the heck I was thinking.

Have a good day, regardless.
